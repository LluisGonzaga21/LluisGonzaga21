### About me :smiley:

I'm Lluis Gonzaga Fuster, programmer and data analyst. I consider myself a lover of technological development, teamwork and learning new tools. I understand programming and data analysis as a way to better understand the world around us, the behavior of people and improve our lives.

I'm currently a student at Campus 42 MÃ¡laga and on Master in Big Data and Business Intelligence. This complements well whit my previous studies: Physics degree and Music School.
